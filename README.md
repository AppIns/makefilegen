# Makefile Generator

Create a makefile easily

Fire up a terminal and type

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AppIns/makefilegen.git
    cd makefilegen
```

After you type that decide if you want to create a server or run it in the browser

```sh
    # For browser
    make browser

    # For servers

    # Windows
    make win

    # Linux or OSX
    make linux
```
